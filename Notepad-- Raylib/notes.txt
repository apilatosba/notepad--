window stretches while resizing that is because raylib doesn't support drawing while resizing. https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/issues/1680
    update: on windows it is still true. no drawing while resizing or repositioning the window but on manjaro kde it draws normally.
    update: got rid of that issue on windows by not using their window manager. use ctrl+m1 to reposition and ctrl+m2 to resize.
dont forget to comment out #define VISUAL_STUDIO before publishing. check Program.cs and every class that inherits from IEditorState
when building with visual studio, set output type to WinExe(windows application) to get rid of console opening when you launch new instance of notepad--.
jpg is not supported.
range of background lucidity is 0-1.
on linux it works with "dotnet notepad--.dll file"
what i liked about the notepad-- project so far:
   Selection implementation is good.
   Undo implementation is good.
what i didn't like about the notepad-- project so far:
   Using state pattern. I should have gone with enum + switch instead. It creates more problems than it actually solves. The only good thing about state pattern is that it makes easier to add new states, you just create a new class and implement the interface but other than that thumbs down.
   Unoptimized shaders
