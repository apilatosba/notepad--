window stretches while resizing that is because raylib doesn't support drawing while resizing. https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/issues/1680

dont forget to comment out #define VISUAL_STUDIO before publishing. check Program.cs and every class that inherits from IEditorState
when building with visual studio, set output type to WinExe(windows application) to get rid of console opening when you launch new instance of notepad--.
jpg is not supported.
range of background lucidity is 0-1.
on linux it works with "dotnet notepad--.dll file"
