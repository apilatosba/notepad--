camera should follow cursor when inserting text
resizable window
scrolling with mouse wheel
cursor positioning with mouse
the font should be setable from settings and i should look for fonts in shared fonts folder (C:\Windows\Fonts, /usr/share/fonts) and my custom fonts folder
fix the bug: characters other than english are not rendered but saved correctly
undo implementation by saving states. i should save not the whole text but only the edited lines. so when user undos, i just swap the lines in the current buffer with the lines in the previous state
add scrollbars
get rid of leftPadding. we have camera now
text selection
text selection rendering
implement zoom
add a status bar at bottom shows the line and column number of cursor and shows the number of lines in the file and shows zoom level
add shortcuts
find in file. ctrl + f
highlight the line the cursor is on
add a settings menu. esc to open
shaders
different effects with shaders. for example a flash effect when you save, text near cursor gets a radial/horizontal gradient color.
add background image
make cursor blink. make it with a shader
