a better last known window size logic. right now if you close the window when it is maximized, it will open maximized but wont remember the restored size. so when you click f11 nothing happens
when pressed minimize window button also set state to whatever the previus state was.
add a status bar at bottom shows the line and column number of cursor and shows the number of lines in the file and shows zoom level. maybe not as status bar but in the EditorStatePaused
config.fontname and program.font has no relationship. when i deserialize i should update the program.font
change cursor y repositioning algorithm. only works with monospace font rn.
i should look for fonts in shared fonts folder (C:\Windows\Fonts, /usr/share/fonts) and my custom fonts folder. change the GetFontPath method
