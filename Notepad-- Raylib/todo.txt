--shaders
character shader. a flash effect when typed. start with pure white then quickly lerp to the original color
different effects with shaders. for example text near cursor gets a radial/horizontal gradient color.
when you ctrl+v paste, dont shiftSelect the pasted text. highlight them instead. do it with a shader
add shortcuts
find in file. ctrl + f
make cursor blink. make it with a shader
switch to window state undecorated
render bloom shader at quarter resolution
    or not. i have better optimization. use two pass blur filter. render it to same rendertexture several times and of course sample the same rendertexture progressively. use weight function. gaussian weight function is good they said.
    or the both
frontend to settings
add scrollbars
directoryview mode add more data to each line. add file size, date modified, etc
   add the absolute path info somewhere
bug: cursor movement doesnt process all inputs if inputs are too fast
add a status bar at bottom shows the line and column number of cursor and shows the number of lines in the file and shows zoom level
config.fontname and program.font has no relationship. when i deserialize i should update the program.font
change cursor y repositioning algorithm. only works with monospace font rn.
i should look for fonts in shared fonts folder (C:\Windows\Fonts, /usr/share/fonts) and my custom fonts folder. change the GetFontPath method
--undo implementation by saving states. i should save not the whole text but only the edited lines. so when user undos, i just swap the lines in the current buffer with the lines in the previous state
