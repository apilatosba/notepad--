--shaders
character shader. a flash effect when typed. start with pure white then quickly lerp to the original color
different effects with shaders. for example text near cursor gets a radial/horizontal gradient color.
implement zoom
when you ctrl+v paste, dont shiftSelect the pasted text. highlight them instead. do it with a shader
add mouse wheel acceleration
add shortcuts
find in file. ctrl + f
make cursor blink. make it with a shader
switch to window state undecorated
changing font size when zooming but loading andunloading font takes about a second which is not good since it creates lag. i should have load a range of fonts with varying sizes but one font with all unicode characters takes up 2mb space. if i were to load, lets say 1-60 sizes, so that is 60 * 2mb which is 120mb. 120mb not good. 
render bloom shader at quarter resolution
    or not. i have better optimization. use two pass blur filter. render it to same rendertexture several times and of course sample the same rendertexture progressively. use weight function. gaussian weight function is good they said.
    or the both
frontend to settings
quit button in editor state paused
add scrollbars
add opening directories. vim style
add a status bar at bottom shows the line and column number of cursor and shows the number of lines in the file and shows zoom level
change cursor y repositioning algorithm. only works with monospace font rn.
i should look for fonts in shared fonts folder (C:\Windows\Fonts, /usr/share/fonts) and my custom fonts folder. change the GetFontPath method
undo implementation by saving states. i should save not the whole text but only the edited lines. so when user undos, i just swap the lines in the current buffer with the lines in the previous state
