--shaders
character shader. a flash effect when typed. start with pure white then quickly lerp to the original color
different effects with shaders. for example text near cursor gets a radial/horizontal gradient color.
implement zoom
when you ctrl+v paste, dont shiftSelect the pasted text. highlight them instead. do it with a shader
add mouse wheel acceleration
add shortcuts
find in file. ctrl + f
make cursor blink. make it with a shader
switch to window state undecorated
check unload methods for all load methods
add scrollbars
add opening directories. vim style
add a status bar at bottom shows the line and column number of cursor and shows the number of lines in the file and shows zoom level
change cursor y repositioning algorithm. only works with monospace font rn.
i should look for fonts in shared fonts folder (C:\Windows\Fonts, /usr/share/fonts) and my custom fonts folder. change the GetFontPath method
undo implementation by saving states. i should save not the whole text but only the edited lines. so when user undos, i just swap the lines in the current buffer with the lines in the previous state
