character shader. a flash effect when typed. start with pure white then quickly lerp to the original color
different effects with shaders. for example text near cursor gets a radial/horizontal gradient color.
implement zoom
add background image
add mouse wheel acceleration
add shortcuts
find in file. ctrl + f
make cursor blink. make it with a shader
add scrollbars
bug: camera is not clamped to the text. it can go beyond the text
add opening directories. vim style
add a status bar at bottom shows the line and column number of cursor and shows the number of lines in the file and shows zoom level
change cursor y repositioning algorithm. only works with monospace font rn.

i should look for fonts in shared fonts folder (C:\Windows\Fonts, /usr/share/fonts) and my custom fonts folder. change the GetFontPath method
undo implementation by saving states. i should save not the whole text but only the edited lines. so when user undos, i just swap the lines in the current buffer with the lines in the previous state
